Starting to understand rem and em, vh, vw a bit more
Still not perfect, but it makes more sense now
Now struggling with designing a good looking form.
Problem with the page not going all the way down to the bottom and there is white space that wont go away.

Figuring out form design is harder than i thought

Restarted my whole format of css and responsive design is not hard i just made it harder than I was supposed to. Ended being easier once I realized what I was doing to the website. Add javascirpt to confirm passwords and gives an alert that passwords match upon submitting. Would like to learn how to make the password boxes green if both of them match but could not figure it out. Overall better attempt doing it a second time.
